Concrete Strength Prediction Models
This repository contains Python scripts and models for predicting concrete strength using different configurations of neural networks. Each configuration represents a different experiment aimed at optimizing model performance.

Files in the Repository
baseline_model_non_normalized.py: Implementation of a baseline neural network model trained on non-normalized data.

model_with_normalized_data.py: Neural network model trained on normalized data to evaluate the impact of data preprocessing on performance.

model_with_more_epochs.py: Neural network model with increased training epochs to assess convergence and potential overfitting.

model_with_more_layers.py: Neural network model with additional layers to explore the impact of network architecture on prediction accuracy.

Setup and Requirements
To run these models, ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:

TensorFlow
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib (for visualization, if applicable)
You can install these dependencies using pip:

Copy code
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib
Running the Models
Each script can be executed individually. For example, to run the baseline model with non-normalized data:

Copy code
python baseline_model_non_normalized.py
Adjust the hyperparameters and configurations in each script as needed based on your experiment goals.

Results
Results from each model configuration are stored within the respective scripts or can be analyzed by examining the output metrics and visualizations generated during training.
